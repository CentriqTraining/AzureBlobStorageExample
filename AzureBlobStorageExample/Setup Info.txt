The demo will attempt to automatically set up everything needed for this
code to run for you.  When you run the code, the AzureAccountManager will 
check for a file in the SetupFiles directory called keys.config.

If this file is not there, it will create it for you by prompting you to 
log into your azure account, choose the appropriate subscription (if there
are more than one) and then create a resource group and storage account.

If this fails, several things could be wrong.

1)  You do not have the correct credentials to your azure account or your
azure account is not properly initialized.

Go to http://portal.azure.com and check to make sure these credentials allow you to 
get to the portal and that from the portal you can create a resource.

2)  You do not have the correct version of windows powershell.
If you open up powershell and type:
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion

You should see version 5.1.17134.  It is possible that this will run on a version 
prior to this, but this is the version that I have and it runs fine on mine.

3)  You do not have the correct version of the Azure Powershell Commands
Visit https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/?sdk=net, scroll down 
until you see Command-line tools and click on Windows Install under Powershell
